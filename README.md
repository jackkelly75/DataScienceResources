	* 3Blue1Brown video that nicely shows self-attention
* [Blog post with overview on self-attention](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-06-24-attention/)


Transformers on tabular data are also a new area of research. These are used in the RG predictions.

* [TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling Using Contextual Embedding](/Resources/Papers/TabTransformer.pdf)
* [Transformers for Tabular Data Representation](/Resources/Papers/TransformersForTabularDataRepresentation.pdf)

With the rise of transformers, embeddings are becoming clearly more important and discussed for all aspects of deep learning. Are probably a good candidate for creation of custom user metrics in the future.
* [Embeddings for numerical features in tabular deep learning](https://research.yandex.com/blog/embeddings-for-numerical-features-in-tabular-deep-learning)
	* Discussion of embeddings of tabular data for input to transformers and DL

There are also a few interesting works on sequence recommendation using transformers
* Alibabas [Behavior Sequence Transformer] (https://github.com/jiwidi/Behavior-Sequence-Transformer-Pytorch)
* NVIDIAs [Transformers4Rec](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/transformers4rec-building-session-based-recommendations-with-an-nvidia-merlin-library/)
